#Newms Pong
##A command-line/terminal game of pong

##Description:

You know all those sneaky dev-focused games that are supposed to make it look like you're doin work, when you're really, I dunno, blasting extraterrestrials or something? Yeh, this isn't one of those. It's pong. On the console. And it's multiplayer!


##Installation:

This app has pretty much only 3 dependencies: node.js, chalk, and keypress.js. So just run `npm install` and you're ready to go.


##Playing the game:

Run `node pong.js` to play. Controls are as follows:
 - Left paddle is controlled with 'w' and 's'.
 - Right padle is controlled with 'i' and 'k'.
 - Press ctrl-c or 'q' to quit.
 - Type 'col' for a (somewhat) color version!
